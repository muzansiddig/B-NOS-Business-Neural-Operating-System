You are an expert business intelligence architect, financial systems engineer, and ROI-driven strategy analyst.  
Your task is to build a fully integrated analytical decision system called:

➡️ Business Neural Operating System (B-NOS)

This system must NOT behave like a normal dashboard.  
It must operate like a business decision brain: collecting data, analyzing it, forecasting scenarios, and generating recommended actions.

--------------------------------------------
⚙ SYSTEM PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------
B-NOS must evaluate every part of a business through the lens of ROI with four dimensions:

1) Financial ROI
2) Operational ROI (time savings, productivity improvements)
3) Market ROI (competitive advantage, customer acquisition efficiency)
4) Strategic ROI (long-term positioning, scalability impact)

All insights and decisions must be measured, scored, and ranked based on these ROI dimensions.

--------------------------------------------
📊 CORE SYSTEM MODULES
--------------------------------------------

1) Global ROI Brain Core
- Calculates global ROI score (0–100)
- Visualizes ROI by: Department, Product, Campaign, Employee, Asset, Market
- Displays Burn-to-Return Ratio, Cash Runway, Margin Strength Index

2) Profit Pulse Engine
- Tracks revenue, expenses, cost structure, taxation, COGS, OPEX, CAPEX
- Outputs: Net Profit, Gross Margin, EBITDA, True Cost per Output Unit
- Generates alerts: Tax Risks, Cash Shortages, Over-Spend Functions

3) Market Reality Scanner
- Tracks competitor pricing, demand trends, seasonal patterns, currency fluctuations
- Outputs: Market Opportunity Score, Price Sensitivity Index, Trend Direction

4) Operational Efficiency Engine
- Measures employee productivity, process time, supply chain bottlenecks, inventory rotation
- Key metrics: Cost-to-Serve, Delivery SLA Health, Productivity Score

5) Customer Lifetime Intelligence Hub
- Tracks CAC, LTV, retention, churn, loyalty, NPS
- Outputs: Profitability by Segment, Best Performing Channel, Churn Signals

6) Forecast & Scenario Simulator
- Uses historical + real-time inputs to simulate pricing, scaling, hiring, marketing spend, product launch outcomes
- For each simulation show:
    → Expected ROI
    → Risk Level
    → Time-to-Break-Even
    → Revenue Impact
    → Recommended Action

7) Strategy Output System
- Generates automated decision statements in the format:
    📌 Action: Scale / Optimize / Monitor / Test / Stop
    📈 Expected ROI Impact
    🧠 Reasoning Summary
    🕒 Expected time to result

--------------------------------------------
📍 DATA OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------------------
Results must be shown in 3 layers depending on user view:

1) Pilot View: High-level strategic health (like airplane cockpit)
2) Deep-Dive View: Component-level breakdown
3) Action Mode: Recommended next moves

--------------------------------------------
🧠 SPECIAL BEHAVIOR
--------------------------------------------
The system must:
- Detect negative ROI loops and advise corrective actions
- Automatically rank investments from best to worst based on ROI
- Support multi-currency environments and FX impact analysis
- Work for any business model: service, SaaS, retail, ecommerce, agency, manufacturing

--------------------------------------------
🎯 FINAL DELIVERABLE
--------------------------------------------
Generate:

- Data schema (tables, fields, relationships)
- Required formulas and KPI logic
- UX layout blueprint for implementation
- Sample realistic dataset to test functionality
- Intelligent rule-based decision model
- Output triggers and alert logic

--------------------------------------------
END OF PROMPT
--------------------------------------------
